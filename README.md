## Note

-On this dashboard cards, I couldn't figure out how to display the weather report from the station cards.


## Bugs

1) Any information that is saved in file.json sometimes takes a while to show however it works.

2) When a report is added it will only display the first entry added, if first entry is deleted the second entry will take its place.
